            Several countries around the world use CCTV systems as forensic evidence to combat crime.
            The cameras cover large fields of view, where low-resolution facial images are typically captured,
            making the identification of the subject of interest very difficult.
            Moreover, distortions caused by video compression, motion blur and poor lighting
            conditions can reduce their effectiveness. Some commercial products have recently included super-resolution
            techniques that fuse consecutive video frames to restore high quality images. Nevertheless, these methods are in most cases insufficient,
            especially when dealing with dynamic non-rigid objects such as faces.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Deep-FIR project aims to design and implement a face image restoration algorithm that is able restore
            very low-resolution facial images captured by CCTV systems with unconstrained pose and orientation.
            The user will be able to restore the whole head, including the hair region, which is important for person identification.
            while minimizing the manual work of the operator.
            </p>

            <p>
            Apart from improving the quality of the restored facial images, this project intends to reduce the complexity
            and therefore the time needed to enhance an image or video frame. The developed algorithm will be tested on
            real-world CCTV videos and compared against existing video forensic tools used by forensic experts in their labs.
            Other than video forensics, the proposed technology can be adopted and used in other sectors. such as video analytics
            and iris recognition.
            </p>

            <p>This project is financed by the Malta Council for Science &amp; Technology, for and on
            behalf of the Foundation for Science and Technology, through the FUSION: R&amp;I Technology Development Programme.
